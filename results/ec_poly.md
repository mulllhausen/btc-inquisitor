the intersection of the tangent line at x = 1 (positive y) with the curve in reduced
form:

`(-1.71875000000000000000000000000, 1.38659220373299553612978074131)`

the equation of the tangent line which passes through x = xp (positive y) on the
curve:

`y = `![\frac{3 xp^{2} \left](7625e1c20a.png)

the equation of the bitcoin elliptic curve:

`y = `![\sqrt{x^{3} + 7}](8ec0febd09.png)


and `y = `![- \sqrt{x^{3} + 7}](bc02a1067b.png)
